Welcome to my blog! 

I'm  junior developer and I wanted to be able to have a place to work out problems, practice testing and challenge myself.  

This blog will be primary written in Ruby so I can get a better understanding of the language however I will discuss my learnings and do problem solving for Javascript, Html, Css and SQL.  

Thanks for checking it out!
